# Team project for a social network.

 As part of the team project, a web application was developed using Spring Boot REST API with Spring Security and JWT tokens, Liquibase, PostgreSQL, WebSocket, and JDBC. My role in the project was to develop dialogs on WebSocket, configure Spring Security using JWT tokens, as well as assist other students and correct various errors. During the project, I learned to work effectively in a team and mastered the Git version control system.
